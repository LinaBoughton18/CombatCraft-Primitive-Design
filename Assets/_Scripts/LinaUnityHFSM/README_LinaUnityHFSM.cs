This folder (LinaUnityHFSM) contains the implementation of the enemy finite state machine logic/behavior
- Pulls from the repository UnityHFSM on GitHub
- The majority of this folder contains files implemented by LlamaAcademy on GitHub, with minor modifications made by me

Directory
FSM: contains scripts that control transitions between enemy states & basic enemy functions
    States: contains concrete implementations of each state, so that they can be allocated to enemies as needed
EnemyTypes: contains concrete implementations of enemy FSM logic. (EX. LlamaEnemy contains six states while FighterEnemy contains only one)
Sensors: contains scripts for objects that can detect different events & calls triggers (EX. PlayerSensor detects when the player moves within range)
Script Spit: a script that handles a partile effect attack


Due to time constraints, I have not yet combined the enemySO behavior with these finite state machine enemies,
but that shall be done in the future.
